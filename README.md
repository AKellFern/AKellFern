# Aaron Kellan-Fernandez

Game Programming & Development student at Southern New Hampshire University with a focus on **gameplay systems, iteration, and Unreal Engine development**. I am interested in building clean, maintainable gameplay mechanics and player-centered systems that balance technical clarity with engaging interaction.

My work emphasizes learning through building, iterative improvement, and clear documentation. Projects here include coursework and prototypes designed to explore gameplay systems, AI behavior, and interactive mechanics within real-world constraints.
